This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict disease outcomes (Malignant vs. Benign) using clinical and genetic features. It uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset to train and evaluate classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases among women 
worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to improving survival rates and ensuring 
effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic procedures, such as imaging and biopsy analysis, are 
often time-consuming and subject to human interpretation. In recent years, the integration of 
machine learning into healthcare has emerged as a promising approach to augment diagnostic 
accuracy and efficiency. 
This study leverages the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, which consists of 30 
numerical features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast 
masses. These features capture various characteristics of the cell nuclei, including radius, texture, 
perimeter, area, and other shape-related attributes. The primary goal is to build a predictive 
model capable of classifying tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) 
based on these clinical features. 
A Logistic Regression model is employed due to its simplicity, interpretability, and 
effectiveness in binary classification problems. The workflow involves data cleaning, 
normalization, training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the practical 
value of machine learning techniques in supporting clinical decision-making and enhancing 
diagnostic accuracy in oncology.
